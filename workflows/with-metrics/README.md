# `with-metrics`

This is an example of how to use the Spell Python API and a Workflow to start runs, stream logs of runs, wait for a run to reach a specific state, or to wait for certain metric values.

## Run it

1. Clone this repo:

   ```ShellSession
   $ git clone https://github.com/spellrun/spell-examples.git
   ```

2. Run the workflow:

   ```ShellSession
   $ cd spell-examples
   $ spell workflow --repo metrics_sender=. python workflows/with-metrics/workflow.py
   ```

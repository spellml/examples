    "Complex machine learning applications often require multi-stage pipelines (e.g., data loading, transforming, training, testing, iterating). **Workflows** in Spell allow you to manage these pipelines as a sequence of Spell runs, and are a lightweight alternative to tools like [Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and [Luigi](https://github.com/spotify/luigi) for managing your model training pipelines.\n",

    "## understanding workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "Every workflow consists of one *master run* and one more more *worker runs*. The master run is responsible for control flow: that is, determining which worker runs should get executed when, and why. The worker runs then do all of the work required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our demo workflow consists of three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. downloading the dataset (a Project Gutenberg copy of _War and Peace_) and saving it to disk.\n",
    "2. mounting that text corpus into a run, training the neural network on it, and saving the model to disk.\n",
    "3. mounting the saved model into yet another run, sampling it for an interesting result, and streaming that output to logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will need one one master run and three worker runs, arranged thusly:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/W5Ugs0S.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple example we will execute the steps consecutively, conditioning the start of each worker run in the workflow on the success of its predecessor. More complex workflows may require more complicated control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the instance type of the worker runs is configurable, the master run always executes on the basic `cpu` instance type. Try to keep any computationally intensive logic isolated to the workers!\n",
    "\n",
    "## understanding the workflow script\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to execute a workflow, we need to define a workflow script. The **workflow script** is what gets executed on the master run: a Python script using the Spell Python API to define worker jobs and the control flow logic surrounding them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a dead-simple workflow script. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it right away, we'll walk through it step by step."

Ludwig is an open-source AutoML toolkit. Ludwig was originally developed internally within Uber. [It was open sourced in February 2019](https://eng.uber.com/introducing-ludwig/), and is presently under incubation with [the Linux Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

This folder is a small demo showing how Ludwig can be run on Spell.

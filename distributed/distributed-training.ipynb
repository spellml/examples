    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers distributed training on Spell using our integration with [horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod), with a code sample in PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Distributed training** is a set of techniques for using GPUs scattered across many different machines for training a machine learning model. `horovod` provides an easy-to-use, performant, cross-platform way of performing distributing model training, making it an essential tool for training very large models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will demonstrate an MNIST PyTorch model adapted for usage with `horovod`. We will then execute these training scripts on Spell, using our built-in Horovod integration: `spell run --distributed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: for code samples using other frameworks checkout the [examples directory](https://github.com/horovod/horovod/tree/master/examples) in the Horovod GH repo.\n",

    "## how it works\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest practical distributed training strategy is the **parameter server model**. In the parameter-server model, there were typically a number of worker processes and a parameter server (using multiple parameter servers was also possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each worker process would be sent a unique batch of data by the parameter server, perform forward and back propogation on that data, and accumulate some gradients. The parameter process would block until it recieves all of the gradient updates from the worker processes, calculate an average gradient, multiply that by the learning rate, and send that back to the worker processes. The worker processes would apply the update before proceeding to the next batch of training.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/luwOpug.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Though conceptually simple, this design proved to have significant limitations. The [blog post accompanying the open sourcing of Horovod](https://eng.uber.com/horovod/) does a good job of summarizing the issues. The TLDR Is that the network overhead cost of having so many fan-out connections between worker processes and parameter services pushes real GPU utilization at scale (64+ GPUs) to 50% or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "Horovod borrows instead from the high performance computing world, using the **ring all-reduce algorithm** to handle gradient updates. This scheme does away with parameter servers, using instead a well-defined sequence of cyclical read and write operations to communicate gradient updates between GPUs directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/vXpNPqC.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this **all-reduce model** every GPU still has a local copy of the model parameters, and these parameters still need to be kept in sync as training proceeds. But since there are no more parameter servers, network throughput (and API complexity) is much improved.\n",
    "\n",
